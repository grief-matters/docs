This section is a work in progress ðŸš§

If there's something we've not covered here (which at the moment is most things ðŸ˜…) then we're probably going to default to a common best practice - and if there's an idiomatic "GitHub way" of doing things, we'll probably work with the platform rather than against it.

If you have any suggestions on how we could do things better reach out ðŸ™Œ

For now, we've got the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) to guide us
