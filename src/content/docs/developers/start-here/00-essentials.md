description: Getting started as a developer on the Why Grief Matters project
---

Welcome developer! It's great to have you here üéâ

There's a few essentials to get through before getting started, but we should have you up and running in no time üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

## GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage all of our code and documentation across the various projects that make up Grief Matters.

Our [organization](https://github.com/grief-matters), is set up as **Grief Matters Inc**., and all of our repositories are attached to this organization. If you are a long-term contributor you may have been invited to [join the organization](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/about-organization-membership). Your membership and [role](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization) within the organization will determine what you can see (and edit) in this area.

## Projects

There is a [single Project on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/grief-matters/projects/1/views/1) from which all development work is coordinated...

## Contributions

We utilise the two common development models at Grief Matters. ["Fork and pull"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model) and ["Shared repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#shared-repository-model)

If you're a long term contributor you may have been added to the organization and assigned a role in one or more of our repositories. If you have `write` access to a repo then you can pull the repo and make pull requests directly.

If you are a transient contributor then you'll be using the "fork and pull" workflow. if you're unfamiliar with the process GitHub have [great docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) on the topic.
