Sanity is a modern headless CMS (Content Management System). Sanity uses structured content to endlessly re-use content across any channel and a composable approach to help businesses connect to any third-party technology, data source, and front end framework.

Before we jump in to Sanity Studio there is some terminology to be familiar with.

### Documents

In Sanity Studio, a document refers to a piece of content like an article, image, or product. It's a structured unit of data with fields that hold information such as text, images, and dates. Documents are the building blocks managed in Sanity Studio's content system, allowing for flexible customization to fit specific project needs.

### Document Types

A "document type" in Sanity Studio is a blueprint for creating specific types of content. It defines the structure and fields that a document of that type can have. For instance, a "Story" document type includes fields for title, description, photograph etc. Document types provide consistency and organization to the content creation process, ensuring that each piece of content follows a predefined format.

### References

In Sanity Studio, "references" are connections between different documents. They allow us to link one document to another, creating relationships between pieces of content. For example, you can reference a "website" document within an "article" document to attribute its "source". These references enhance content management and enable dynamic updates, as changes to a referenced document automatically reflect in all connected instances.
