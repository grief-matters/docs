This guide will help you get started using the **Why Grief Matters Content Management System (CMS)**. The CMS is an implementation of [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio).

Before contributing to the Why Grief Matters CMS project as a **Content Editor** you'll need to be **invited** to the `grief-matters-cms` project hosted on Sanity.io by someone with the `Administrator` role. Currently the only admin is Dan, so if you need an invite contact him at [dan@danlechambre.com](mailto:dan@danlechambre.com?subject=Request%20invite%20to%20WGM%20CMS).

Once you've received an invitation you'll need to set up an account on [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/login/sign-up). Your Sanity account is what you'll log in to the CMS with.

Once your account is all set up go to the Sanity Studio at <https://grief-matters-sanity-studio.netlify.app> to log in.
