In the bottom right of the document editor there are a number of **document actions** available based on the state or type of the current document. You may see some or all of these options in specific scenarios.

![Document actions](@assets//unpublish-discard@2x.png)

**1. Unpublish:** allows you to unpublish a document - this will remove it from the next build of the Grief Matters website.

**2. Discard Changes:** allows you to discard any changes made since the last published version of the document (in essence, deleting the current draft)

**3. Duplicate:** [[TODO - any control over the output?]]

**4. Delete:** this will delete the current document.

**5. Convert Resource:** will allow you to convert certain document types from one type to another - this will help where resources have been created as one type but are later identified as being another.

**Warning:** Some information may be lost during the conversion process - such as if you convert a 'Book' to an 'Article' - the ISBN and Author fields will be removed
