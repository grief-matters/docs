Documents in Sanity can be in various states depending on what stage of the content editing lifecycle they are at.

The states are indicated in both the document list view as well as in the document editor.

### Draft

When a document is first created it will be in the **draft** state. A document that is in **draft** does not yet show on our website until it is published. All changes are saved automatically so a document can go through several revisions before it is published.

A document will also move to **draft** when changes have been made to a **published** document. The previously published version will remain visible on our website until the draft changes have been reviewed and published.

The **draft** state is generally indicated by a yellow pencil:

### Ready for Review

A document in **draft** must be marked as **ready for review** once the changes are ready to publish. This toggle is only available on new draft documents or previously published documents with changes.

The **pending review** state is generally indicated by a purple clock:

To move a document into the ready for review state, you can activate the toggle on the document:

### Published

Documents that have been marked as **ready for review** are then able to be **published**. This provides an extra step of protection to ensure that changes are approved before being published to the website.

Only authorized Sanity accounts are able to publish documents.

The **published** state is indicated by a green up arrow icon:
