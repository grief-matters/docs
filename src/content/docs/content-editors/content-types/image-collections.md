title: "Image Collections"

**Image Collections** are exactly what they sound like. The primary purpose for having image collections is that we need a set of fallback images to deal with any missing images. One such example would be adding a **Featured Story** to a category that does not have an image assigned to it. We don't want this to cause the website build to fail, we also don't want any errors for missing images, so what we can do instead is present an image from an image collection.

Image Collections can be found alongside other document types. Presently we have only one image collection called **"Generic Fallbacks"**. This is the _special_ collection used for the use case above. As such the images we add to it could be used to preface any category, story, article where an image is used. As such, we should be careful that the images in this collection are completely atopical. Given the current design of the website, nature and landscape photographs could be good choices, but there are no strict requirements. Just be mindful that any image added could be presented alongside any resource.

## Creating and adding to an image collection

Presently we have no additional use cases to add more image collections, but adding an image collection is much the same as [creating any other document](/content-editing/creating-documents), and adding images to the collection is much the same as [adding images](/content-editing/images) elsewhere in the CMS.
